Additions:

add to .gitignore files that you dont wont to push to github (Example: venv, __pycache__)

for better usage i recommend to add in the end of .bashrc file located in your home dir following code:

parse_git_branch() {
      git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h: \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "

And then type in console:
source ~/.bashrc
